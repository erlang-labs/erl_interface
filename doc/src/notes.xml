	    The documentation is now built with open source tools
	    (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

	    The manual states that erl_receive() return the reason in
	    the <c>ErlMessage</c> struct. This was not the case and
	    the function is now corrected.</p>

          <p>
	    In <c>send_exit.c</c> an errorneous size of memory
	    allocation could occur when reallocating a buffer.</p>
          <p>
	    In <c>ei_decode_trace.c</c> the index could be updated
	    when the decoding failed.</p>
          <p>
	    In <c>ei_printterm.c</c> the index could be updated when
	    the decoding failed in lists and tuples.</p>
          <p>
	    In <c>ei_decode_term.c</c> when decoding a double
	    (ERL_FLOAT_EXT) no check was done to ensure that the last
	    of the 31 bytes was null terminated.</p>
          <p>
	    In <c>ei_decode_term.c</c> when decoding references, only
	    the first 3 bytes are read, but the index did not
	    increment by the total size.</p>
          <p>
	    In <c>ei_decode_fun.c</c> no check of correct buffer
	    allocation or data length was done.</p>
          <p>
	    In <c>ei_decode_string.c</c> the integer list string case
	    did not decode the NIL tail correctly.</p>
          <p>
	    These errors has now been fixed. (Thanks to Romain
	    Lenglet, Paul Mineiro and Paul Guyot).</p>

          <p>ei_print_term interprets a list of integers with values
            from 0 to 255 as a string. If the original list contains
            the integer 0, this is considered terminator of the
            string. This is incorrect. The function has now been
            modified to not look for '\\0' in a string, but always
            print all characters.</p>
